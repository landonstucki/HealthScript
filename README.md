# Overview

This program was created to test my capabilities of C# by creating software that could be used later in a 3D Game Engine Environment.

This software is a Script to manage Health Points. It includes game scenario with combat between an enemy and a player featuring two different types of healing options and death case.

# Future Work

- Editing the health system to completely separate the types of healing items into their own classes that use a master class as reference. 
(Example: Master Class = Food.Cs (containing healing properties, cost) then creating separate classes for each food item, Bread.Cs (5 | 5) <- Heals 5, Costs 5.)
- Transfer/Convert into full attachable script for Unity (3D Game Engine C#).
